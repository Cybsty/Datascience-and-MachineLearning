Global AI and Machine Learning Compensation Trends

This project is a quantified analysis of global AI/ML job market trends. The goal was to move beyond simple averages and determine the true drivers of compensation, utilizing a comprehensive Kaggle dataset.

The analysis led to two primary, data-backed conclusions:

 Experience is the Core Driver: A Seaborn regression analysis confirmed an extremely strong positive correlation (\mathbf{r=0.74}) between an employee's Years of Experience and their salary.

 Seniority Pays a Premium: The largest single salary jump occurs between Senior and Executive roles, with Executive salaries averaging \mathbf{\$188,000} USD.

The complete submission package includes:

 The Final Deliverable: The MP4 Video Presentation, which visually explains these key findings and charts.

 The Documentation: The detailed Final Analysis Report (.md) covering the methodology and metrics.

 The Source Code: The Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) containing all the Python code for data processing and statistical regression.
